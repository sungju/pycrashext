INSTRUCTION: lea
lea - Load effective address
     The lea instruction places the address specified by its
     first operandinto the register specified by its second
     operand.Note, the contents of the memory location are
     notloaded, only the effective address is computed and
     placed into the register.This is useful for obtaining
     a pointer into a memory region or to perform simple
     arithmetic operations.

     Syntax
     lea <mem>, <reg32>

     Examples
     lea (%ebx,%esi,8), %edi - the quantity EBX+8*ESI is placed in EDI.
     lea val(,1), %eax - the value val is placed in EAX.
END_INSTRUCTION: lea

INSTRUCTION: je jne jz jg jge jl jle
j<condition> - Conditional jump

        These instructions are conditional jumps that are based on
        the status ofa set of condition codes that are stored in a
        special register calledthe machine status word. The contents
        of the machine statusword include information about the last
        arithmetic operationperformed. For example, one bit of this
        word indicates if the lastresult was zero. Another indicates
        if the last result wasnegative. Based on these condition codes,
        a number of conditional jumpscan be performed. For example,
        the jzinstruction performs a jump to the specified operand label
        if the resultof the last arithmetic operation was zero.
        Otherwise, control proceedsto the next instruction in sequence.

        A number of the conditional branches are given names that
        areintuitively based on the last operation performed being
        a specialcompare instruction, cmp (see below). For example,
        conditional branchessuch as jle and jne are based on first
        performing a cmp operationon the desired operands.


        Syntax
            je <label> (jump when equal)
            jne <label> (jump when not equal)
            jz <label> (jump when last result was zero)
            jg <label> (jump when greater than)
            jge <label> (jump when greater than or equal to)
            jl <label> (jump when less than)
            jle <label> (jump when less than or equal to)

        Example
            cmp %ebx, %eax
            jle done

            If the contents of EAX are less than or equal to the contents
            of EBX,jump to the label done.  Otherwise, continue to the
            nextinstruction.
END_INSTRUCTION: je jne jz jg jge jl jle

INSTRUCTION: mov movb
mov - Move
	The mov instruction copies the data item referred to by its first 
	operand (i.e. register contents, memory contents, or a constant 
	value) into the location referred to by its second operand
	(i.e. a register or memory). While register-to-register moves are 
	possible, direct memory-to-memory moves are not.

	In cases where memory transfers are desired, the source memory
	contents must first be loaded into a register, then can be stored
	to the destination memory address.

	Syntax
	mov <reg>, <reg>
	mov <reg>, <mem>
	mov <mem>, <reg>
	mov <con>, <reg>
	mov <con>, <mem>

	Examples
	mov %ebx, %eax - copy the value in EBX into EAX
	movb $5, var(,1) - store the value 5 into the byte at location var
END_INSTRUCTION: mov movb

INSTRUCTION: push
push - Push on stack
	The push instruction places its operand onto the top of the hardware
	supported stack in memory. Specifically, push first decrements ESP by 4,
	then places its operand into the contents of the 32-bit location 
	at address (%esp). ESP (the stack pointer) is decremented by push 
	since the x86 stack grows down - i.e. the stack grows from high 
	addresses to lower addresses.

	Syntax
	push <reg32>
	push <mem>
	push <con32>

	Examples
	push %eax - push eax on the stack
	push var(,1) - push the 4 bytes at address var onto the stack
END_INSTRUCTION: push

INSTRUCTION: pop
pop - Pop from stack
	The pop instruction removes the 4-byte data element from the top of
	the hardware-supported stack into the specified operand (i.e. register
	or memory location). It first moves the 4 bytes located at memory
	location (%esp) into the specified register or memory location,
	and then increments ESP by 4.

	Syntax
	pop <reg32>
	pop <mem>

	Examples
	pop %edi - pop the top element of the stack into EDI.
	pop (%ebx) - pop the top element of the stack into memory at the 
				 four bytes starting at location EBX.
END_INSTRUCTION: pop

INSTRUCTION: shl shr
shl, shr - Shift left and right
	These instructions shift the bits in their first operand's contents
	left and right, padding the resulting empty bit positions with zeros.
	The shifted operand can be shifted up to 31 places. The number of
	bits to shift is specified by the second operand, which can be
	either an 8-bit constant or the register CL. In either case, shifts
	counts of greater then 31 are performed modulo 32.

	Syntax
	shl <con8>, <reg>
	shl <con8>, <mem>
	shl %cl, <reg>
	shl %cl, <mem>
	shr <con8>, <reg>
	shr <con8>, <mem>
	shr %cl, <reg>
	shr %cl, <mem>

	Examples
	shl $1, eax - Multiply the value of EAX by 2 (if the most
		      significant bit is 0)
	shr %cl, %ebx - Store in EBX the floor of result of dividing the value 
			of EBX by 2^n where n is the value in CL. 
			Caution: for negative integers, it is different from
			the C semantics of division!
END_INSTRUCTION: shl shr

ARCHITECTURE: arm

INSTRUCTION: mov mvn neg
Move, Move NOT, and Negate.

  Syntax
    MOV Rd, #expr
    MOV Rd, Rm
    MVN Rd, Rm
    NEG Rd, Rm

where:
Rd
  is the destination register.
expr
  is an expression that evaluates (at assembly time)to an integer in the range 0-255.
Rm
  is the source register.

Usage
  The MOV instruction places #expr, or the value from Rm, in Rd.
  The MVN instruction takes the value in Rm, performs a bitwise logical NOT operation on the value, and places the result in Rd.
  The NEG instruction takes the value in Rm, multiplies it by -1, and places the result in Rd.

Restrictions

  In MOV Rd,#expr, MVN, and NEG instructions, Rd and Rm must be in the range r0 to r7.
  In MOV Rd, Rm instructions, Rd and Rm can be any register r0 to r15, but see Condition flags.

Condition flags
  MOV Rd,#expr and MVN instructions update the N and Z flags. They have no effect on the C or V flags.
  NEG instructions update the N, Z, C, and V flags.
  MOV Rd, Rm behaves as follows:
    - if either Rd or Rm is a high register (r8-r15), the flags are unaffected
    - if both Rd and Rm are low registers (r0-r7), the N and Z flags are updated, and C and V flags are cleared.

    Note
    You can use LSL, with a shift of zero, to move between low registers without clearing the C and V flags (see ASR, LSL, LSR, and ROR).

Architectures
  These instructions are available in all T variants of the ARM architecture.

Examples
    MOV r3,#0
    MOV r0,r12  ; does not update flags
    MVN r7,r1
    NEG r2,r2

Incorrect examples
    MOV r2,#256 ; immediate value out of range
    MOV r8,#3   ; cannot move immediate to high register
    MVN r8,r2   ; high registers not allowed with MVN or NEG
    NEG r0,#3   ; immediate value not allowed with MVN or NEG

END_INSTRUCTION: mov mvn neg
